It was so great today that I make my first molten cake. Basically this was a chocolate cake with melt chocolate inside.

Well because this was my first baking experience, I think there could be more way to improve this (like presentation, missing ingredients, etc). But overall for the taste, it was really good. My wife and daughter enjoy this cake very much.
